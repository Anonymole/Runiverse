# Chapter one
## Paradise Found
The transport *Meridian* shuddered as it broke through Kepler-442c's atmosphere, its heat shields glowing cherry-red against the alien sky. Commander Elena Vasquez gripped her restraints, watching the readouts cascade across her display in impossible shades of green and blue. After one hundred and forty-two years of automated terraforming reports, the biodrone's promises seemed too good to be true.

"Atmospheric composition holding steady," reported Dr. Marcus Chen from the co-pilot's seat, his voice tight with anticipation. "Oxygen at twenty-one percent, nitrogen seventy-eight. It's... it's exactly like Earth."

Elena allowed herself a brief smile. The first human eyes to witness this world, this second Eden that Earth's children had crafted from sterile rock and ice. Below them, vast continents spread like watercolor paintings—emerald forests giving way to sapphire oceans, mountain ranges crowned with snow that sparkled like scattered diamonds.

"Biodrone Seven-Seven-Alpha should be transmitting from the southern continent," Marcus said, adjusting the communication array. "Signal's strong. Whatever our mechanical gardener's been up to down there, it's still operational after all these years."

The transport banked left, following the coordinates that had been beaming toward Earth for over a century. Elena watched the landscape scroll beneath them—rivers that meandered through valleys thick with vegetation, coastlines where waves crashed against beaches of black volcanic sand. Every report had been meticulously catalogued: the introduction of cyanobacteria, the careful cultivation of fungi networks, the gradual seeding of increasingly complex organisms. Twenty years of microbes and mosses, followed by decades of marine life, insects, small mammals, and finally the larger fauna that would complete the ecosystem.

"There," Marcus pointed through the viewport. "The primary seeding station."

A cluster of geometric structures rose from a clearing in the forest, their surfaces gleaming with the same adaptive materials that had survived the long journey from Earth. The biodrone's main facility—part laboratory, part nursery, part factory of life itself. As they descended, Elena could see movement in the surrounding trees, shapes that darted through the canopy with fluid grace.

"Jesus," Marcus whispered, pressing his face to the viewport. "Are those—are those deer? They're massive."

Elena followed his gaze and felt her breath catch. The creatures below were indeed deer-like, but their antlers seemed to shimmer with an opalescent sheen, and they moved with a peculiar weightlessness, as if gravity held only a casual claim on them. One looked up at the approaching transport, and for a moment Elena could have sworn she saw intelligence in its eyes—not the simple awareness of an animal, but something deeper.

The landing was smooth, the transport's legs extending to kiss the alien soil with barely a tremor. Elena and Marcus went through their post-flight checklist with practiced efficiency, but she could feel the electric anticipation thrumming between them. Outside, the air was clean and sweet, filtered through a hundred and forty years of careful biological engineering.

"Preliminary scans show no immediate toxins or pathogens," Marcus reported, already reaching for his specimen collection kit. "Though we should maintain protective protocols until—"

A sound interrupted him—a melodic chiming that seemed to come from the forest itself, as if the trees were singing. Elena turned toward the source and froze. A figure was emerging from between the massive ferns that bordered the clearing, walking with unhurried grace toward their landing site.

It was humanoid but clearly not human. Tall and willowy, with skin that held a faint greenish tinge and hair that moved as if underwater despite the still air. Most unsettling were its eyes—completely black, like pools of deep space, yet somehow warm and welcoming.

"Elena," Marcus said quietly, his hand moving instinctively toward the sidearm at his belt. "The reports never mentioned—"

"Welcome," the figure said, its voice carrying the same musical quality as the forest's song. When it smiled, Elena noticed its teeth were the color of pearls, each one perfectly formed. "We have been waiting for you to come home."

Elena felt the universe tilt slightly on its axis. The biodrone's reports had been thorough, mechanical, precise. There had been no mention of intelligence beyond the carefully calculated introduction of Earth species. No mention of beings that could speak, that could think, that could stand in a clearing on an alien world and call it home.

"We?" Elena managed to ask.

The being gestured toward the forest, and Elena saw them now—dozens of figures moving between the trees, some tall like this first one, others smaller, more compact. All of them watching with those dark, knowing eyes.

"We are the children of your gardens," the being said. "Born from the marriage of your seeds and our world's... unique gifts." It paused, tilting its head with curiosity. "Did your machine not tell you? Did it not report that magic flows through this world like water through stone, touching all things, changing all things?"

Marcus made a small sound of disbelief. Elena felt her carefully constructed understanding of their mission crumbling away. They had come to claim paradise, to establish humanity's first colony beyond the solar system. Instead, they had discovered something impossible—a world where Earth's children had evolved into something else entirely, something that spoke of magic as casually as others might discuss the weather.

The being stepped closer, extending one long-fingered hand in what was unmistakably a gesture of greeting. "I am called Verdant-Song-of-Growing-Things. But you may call me Verde, if it is easier for your tongues. We have much to show you about the world you helped create."
