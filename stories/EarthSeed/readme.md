A prelimary story created for collaborative creation.
## Premise
### Seeding
Earth sends an automomous biobot out into the galaxy.  
The bot is equipped with all the biological entities to allow an Earth 2.0 to spawn from the nascent enviornment it finds on a candidate planet.  
It begins to rain down cyanobacteria and fungi, after twenty years, it begins to seed the planet with mosses and ferns. Then zooplankton, algaes and primitive sea creatures capable of living in the burgeoning O2 environment.  
The terraforming proceeds apace, until... An unknown feature of the planet, a magnetic quantum twist in its origination history causes life there to be imbued with supernatural powers.
The biodrone continues its directives.  
It begins to seed the planet with more and more advanced life.  
All the while it has been transmitting its progress back to Earth.
### Arrival
After one hundred and forty-two years, Earthlings arrive to discover an oasis planet replete with all that might compose a paradise world.  
There's only one problem.  
Creatures there are magical.
